# H-Field-Model

This repository contains the **PDF source** for the **Hyparxis Field Model**, a covariant scalar–tensor framework with an informational order parameter and screening mechanisms.

## Overview

The Hyparxis Field Model introduces a single ultralight scalar field \(H(x)\) that:

- Mediates a long-range interaction that is dynamically screened in high-density regions.
- Acts as a covariant phenomenological order parameter responding to local spacetime structure.
- Can drive late-time cosmic acceleration in underdense regions.
